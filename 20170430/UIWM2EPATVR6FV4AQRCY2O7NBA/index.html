But the soldier, rolling back his sleeve to reveal his scars, shouted,　"When you were in danger at Actium, I did not choose a substitute but fought for you in person."　This persuaded Augustus to appear in court on the veteran's behalf.*<br>奧古斯都是羅馬帝國第一位皇帝，也是尤利烏斯．凱撒的指定繼承人，公元前三十一年，在亞克提姆戰役之中，擊敗馬克．安東尼，成為羅馬帝國唯一統治者。<br>有一個老兵，涉及訴訟，見案情似對他不利，就在一公眾場所，向其前指揮官奧古斯都求助，請他上法庭代為陳言。奧古斯都馬上挑選一名隨從，囑他為那老兵上庭，並介紹給那老兵相識。那老兵捲起衣袖，露出傷疤，高聲說：「當年亞克提姆一戰，陛下身處險境，我為陛下奮戰，可沒有挑人代勞。」奧古斯都於是親上法庭為那老兵陳詞。*<br>*老將傷疤，最能感動人君。唐太宗曾問勇將尉遲敬德：「人言卿反，何故？」尉遲敬德「解衣投於地，見所傷之處（當年征戰傷疤）」，太宗垂淚請他穿回衣服：「卿衣矣，朕以不疑卿，故此相告。」（《隋唐嘉話》卷中）</p><p>難得生性暴龍哥創科眾籌夢，遭隱世肥報販秒殺！  https://goo.gl/hnEB7D <br> <br>「蘋果VR」App<br>App store下載： https://goo.gl/0kW2cK <br>Google Play下載： https://goo.gl/4K7EHw  </p></body></html>
