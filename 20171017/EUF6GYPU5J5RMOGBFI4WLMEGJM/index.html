Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow were already punished by a court a year ago. Joshua and Nathan respectively served 80 and 120 hours of community service, and Alex received a three-week suspended sentence. Yet the Hong Kong government decided to reopen the case and sought tougher punishments.<br>The law under which they were charged, the Public Order Ordinance, has been criticized by the United Nations for “facilitat[ing] excessive restrictions” to basic rights, and is incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights（ICCPR）, which applies to Hong Kong. Human rights organisations have long urged Hong Kong to revise the ordinance to comply with the ICCPR.<br>Serious concerns over the independence of the judiciary arise. Court of Final Appeal judge Kemal Bokhary warned of “storm clouds” over the judiciary five years ago. Hong Kong’s judges want to protect its independence, but they face increasing pressure from Beijing. In 2014, China issued a White Paper declaring that Beijing has “comprehensive jurisdiction over Hong Kong” – instead of “the high degree of autonomy” provided for in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution. China also announced that Hong Kong’s judges are merely “administrators” who must love the country and be "subject to oversight by the central government”. The independence of the judiciary, a pillar of Hong Kong, risks becoming a charade, at the beck and call of the Chinese Communist Party.<br>Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic freedoms, at the heart of the principle of “one country, two systems”, now face grave threats.<br>Kirsty Brimelow QC<br>Patrick Burgess Australia – former head of human rights in the UN in East Timor and President of Asia Justice and Rights（AJAR）.<br>Lord Carlile of Berriew CBE QC<br>Sir Desmond De Silva QC<br>Lord Falconer of Thoroton QC – former Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice<br>Jared Genser – Freedom Now<br>Justice Richard Goldstone（South Africa）<br>Andrew Khoo（Malaysia）<br>David Matas（Canada）<br>Michael Mansfield QC<br>Rajiv Menon QC<br>Sir Geoffrey Nice QC – former chief prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic </p></body></html>
